# Company Oriented Project 2

# Weekly Report By Harjit

# Week 1: 17.01.2017 - 20.01.2017
1)  The project started from this week. I have got the basic website to start with. Since it is in php, I will need some time to understand and work on it. I had to setup server and database on my machine. Even the sample I got from the website need to be installed first before using. I had to figure out how to install it as there were some specified ways to install it 

2)  I have just setup the project and I have to start it from next week. This week just had 3 days and it was very short to start.

3)  Have to go through some tutorials before starting the project as I am not used to php. The website that the company asked me to get reference from is very vast.

4)  Kickoff meeting and looking through the company slides for my tasks for the project (1 hour)
    Tutorials for php, server and database (2 hours)
    Preparing all the documents before starting the project		(2 hours)
    Setting up server and database (2 hours)
    Downloading the project and installing (3 hours)

# Week 2: 21.01.2017 - 27.01.2017
1)  The slide was misleading as it was written that the company has decided to use the existing website opencart and I spent all my time figuring how the website actually worked and I was confused where I actually had to implement the function that I was supposed to do. Then Juha said that I to develop it myself not referencing the website opencart. I started the development by first making the preview page for the website at first. It allows user to upload a photo to the browser and the website provides a preview of the image provided. This doesnot interact with the database yet. 

2)  Next week I will start working on the image processing for the previewed picture.

3)  There was a misunderstanding with the company that I am doing this project with. According to the presentation that they sent me it said that they are going to use the commercially available website Opencart but later when I inquired exactly what they needed it turned out that they'll use the website once I finished my part of the project.

4)  understanding the architecture of opencart (3 hours)
    Making basic architecture wiht image preview (4 hours)
